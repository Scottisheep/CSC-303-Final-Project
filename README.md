## Overview
This is a two player fighting game, where the first person to land a hit on the other wins.

## How To Play
The left player moves with the A and D keys, and attacks with T. The right player moves with the left and right arrow keys, and attacks with comma.
Moving in a direction while hitting the attack key will do a directional attack, while standing still and attacking does a neutral attack.
